# GameAssignment3
My third OOP assignment in year 2, a basic version of the game Reversi (Othello). 

Abstract:
Team members: Just me (Ben).
Language: Java.

I will try to implement a version of the game Reversi, which was available on Windows XP
computers back in the day. I will also try and implement a gui, using the Java Swing
library.




NO Longer Applicable:
So I've learned the Python language for this assignment. Nice easy language so long 
as you don't want to use any none standard packages. If you do, then all of a sudden 
it becomes the stupidest programming language in the world! I would never ever
reccommend it  to learn to anyone based on how ridiculously impossible it is to
get these third party packages to just even install without having huge knowledge
of compiling these packages. And the documentation online is terrible! I'm doing
this assignment in Java now. Within ten minutes research I've found an abundance of
documentation for different things that I want to do, and even some video tutorials.
I will never ever use Python again, I hate it as a language!!

My aim is to have implemented a somewhat basic for of a DAW program, like
Cakewalk, or Pro Tools. I should be able to connect a guitar, bass, microphone
to the laptop and record the raw sound and then manipulate that sound and add
effects to the instruments. I should be able to play back these "tracks", and
be able to have multiple "tracks" play back at any one time. So the goal is to
be able to produce an entire song and be able to save all the instruments together
into one sound file. I'm going to try also have the ability to work with midi
files, many professional DAWs can take midi files and emulate real instruments,
so I will have to do plenty of research on this element of the project. Midi files 
would be very useful for drum tracks, if I'm able to obtain authentic sounding
drum sounds.
