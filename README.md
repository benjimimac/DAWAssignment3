# DAWAssignment3
My third OOP assignment in year 2, a basic Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). These are commonly used to produce, edit and master music.

Abstract:
Team members: Just me (Ben).
Language: Python.

So I'm learning the Python language for this assignment, going well so far.
My aim is to have implemented a somewhat basic for of a DAW program, like
Cakewalk, or Pro Tools. I should be able to connect a guitar, bass, microphone
to the laptop and record the raw sound and then manipulate that sound and add
effects to the instruments. I should be able to play back these "tracks", and
be able to have multiple "tracks" play back at any one time. So the goal is to
be able to produce an entire song and be able to save all the instruments together
into one sound file. I'm going to try also have the ability to work with midi
files, many professional DAWs can take midi files and emulate real instruments,
so I will have to do plenty of research on this element of the project. Midi files 
would be very useful for drum tracks, if I'm able to obtain authentic sounding
drum sounds.
